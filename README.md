## :warning: **The dark-constrast-syntax Atom theme is not maintained anymore. Version 0.2.0 still works as of 2022-09-22 but I cannot guarantee that it will continue to work in the future. Commit 74294126bb119939c9a3f56971b33cb759e27aa3 renames deprecated selectors but apm does not work anymore so I could not push this as version 0.3.0 so from within Atom you can only install 0.2.0. I wish my fellow dark moders the best, thanks for using the theme!**
